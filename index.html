            My beautiful wife,
        </p>
        <p>
            I know I'm not the greatest with words, but do you remember the very first day that we met? I remember I had just made Lemon chicken and pasta for 40 people and was exhausted laying on a couch; over the next three weeks, we hung out even more.
        </p>
        <p>
            I knew the very first moment I saw you. I knew we were meant to be together for all of our days, but one night, we hung out all day going around Austin; I walked you to your writing class after I walked you in, I had to walk back 4 miles to get home as my phone just died.
        </p>
        <p>
            I didn't mind as I had a smile on my face the whole way back to the house as I knew I had found my companion and my best friend. There's no one else I'd want to build a life with. I get to have you by my side, my love and my wife, for eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, I promise to be your navigator and sidekick in all of life's adventures. I promise to be your best friend and your husband.

        </p>

        <p>
            I promise you myself completely. I am there in the adventures. The coffee shop runs, your money-making schemes, cooking experiments, career goals, the travelling the world together. The fun times, the great times, the times we stay up too late binge-watching Netflix, the times we need each other, and supporting each other in the fun times and the coffee-filled days. I will be there by your side, every step of the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love you with my whole heart with a passion that can't be expressed in words, only in kisses, glances, and years of adventure by your side. When I met you, I was at a crossroads in my life; it opened my life to what love and friendship are; you changed my life. You are my rock.
            I love this quote and think of us,
        </p>

        <p>
            When I am with you, everything else fades to the background. You flood my senses with joy. You are my life, my greatest gift. I'm so lucky to call you my loving wife, and I wish to be the support you need every day. To be your best friend and to make you proud.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love you with all my heart.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your husband ❤️ ☕ ☘️
