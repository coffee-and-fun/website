						Privacy Statement
					  </h1>
					  <p class="mb-8 text-lg text-black">
						Hey there! At Coffee & Fun, we’re not just about brewing innovative apps; we’re also serious about safeguarding your privacy. It's our promise to you: no sneaky data collection, no prying into your personal information. We’re in the business of creating fun, not tracking data.
					  </p>
				  
					  <h2 class="my-3 mb-4 text-2xl text-black font-bold">
						Data Collection Across All Apps
					  </h2>
					  <p class="mb-3 text-lg text-black">
						Whether you’re using any of our apps, rest easy knowing we don't collect personal info, browsing histories, or any data from your device. We respect your privacy like we love our coffee – immensely and genuinely.
					  </p>
				  
					  <h2 class="my-3 mb-4 text-2xl text-black font-bold">
						Data Usage
					  </h2>
					  <p class="mb-3 text-lg text-black">
						Our policy is simple – no data collection means nothing to use, store, or share. Your activities in all our apps stay right where they belong: with you.
					  </p>
				  
					  <h2 class="my-3 mb-4 text-2xl text-black font-bold">
						Data Security
					  </h2>
					  <p class="mb-3 text-lg text-black">
						Imagine a vault. Now, think of our apps as vaults for your data. They operate in a self-contained universe within your device, with no data transmission or external storage. We’re all about keeping things secure and in your control.
					  </p>
				  
					  <h2 class="my-3 mb-4 text-2xl text-black font-bold">
						Continuous Improvements
					  </h2>
					  <p class="mb-3 text-lg text-black">
						We're committed to constantly improving our apps. Any updates we roll out will focus on making your experience better and brighter, while our stance on privacy and data protection remains as firm as ever.
					  </p>
				  
					  <h2 class="my-3 mb-4 text-2xl text-black font-bold">
						Third-Party Services? No, Thanks!
					  </h2>
					  <p class="mb-3 text-lg text-black">
						Our apps are free of third-party services that might peek into your data. We believe in a closed loop – just us, our apps, and the awesome you, with no external prying eyes.
					  </p>
				  
					  <h2 class="my-3 mb-4 text-2xl text-black font-bold">
						Your Privacy is Our Priority
					  </h2>
					  <p class="mb-3 text-lg text-black">
						We get it – privacy is a big deal, and we treat it that way. When you use any of our apps, your information is as safe as a secret in a friend’s heart.
					  </p>
				  
					  <h2 class="my-3 mb-4 text-2xl text-black font-bold">
						Got Questions?
					  </h2>
					  <p class="mb-3 text-lg text-black">
