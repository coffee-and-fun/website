This post is part of our research into creating an AI/ChatGPT grading estimator for Pokémon cards. As part of this experiment, we’ve ordered three professionally graded cards—a PSA 10, PSA 9, and PSA 8—to study the differences in how cards are evaluated. By understanding PSA’s grading criteria and seeing these grades in action, we aim to replicate the grading process with an AI-powered tool that can analyze centering, edges, corners, and surface conditions.



# How PSA Grades Pokémon Cards

## 1. Centering

Centering refers to how evenly the card's artwork is positioned between its borders. PSA evaluates centering on both the **front** and **back** of the card, but the front is given more weight since it is the focal point.

### Centering Measurements

PSA measures centering as a percentage, comparing the thickness of opposite borders (e.g., left vs. right or top vs. bottom).
**Example:** If the left border is 55% of the total width and the right border is 45%, the centering is **55/45**.

### Centering Tolerances
#### SA 10 (Gem Mint)
  - Front: 55/45 or better.
  - Back: 75/25 or better.

#### PSA 9 (Mint)
  - Front: 60/40 or better.
  - Back: 90/10 or better.

Cards outside these tolerances receive lower grades because off-centering affects the visual appeal.

## 2. Corners

Corners are evaluated for sharpness, wear, and overall cleanliness. Perfect corners are sharp and free of fuzziness, bends, or dings.

### How PSA Evaluates Corners

#### Sharpness 

Perfect corners will have crisp, sharp edges. Rounded or fuzzy corners lower the grade.

#### Damage

Whitening, bends, or nicks on the corners are signs of wear.

#### Focus Areas

PSA examines corners carefully under magnification to detect subtle imperfections.

### Perfect Corners for PSA 10

**PSA 10 corners** will look flawless, even under 10x magnification.

Minor flaws like very slight whitening can drop the card to a PSA 9.

---

## 3. Edges
Edges are the borders of the card and are examined for chipping, whitening, or other visible damage.

### What PSA Looks For in Edges

#### Clean Edges

Edges should be smooth and free of chipping or peeling.

#### Whitening

Common on Pokémon cards with dark-colored borders. Any whitening can lower the grade.

#### Foil Damage

On holo cards, PSA looks for foil or printing damage near the edges.

### Perfect Edges for PSA 10

Edges should appear crisp and clean with no whitening or wear.

Minor edge flaws can reduce the grade to PSA 9 or lower.

---

## 4. Surface

The surface of the card is evaluated for scratches, stains, dents, creases, and overall cleanliness.

### What PSA Looks For in Surface Grading

#### Scratches

Common on holographic Pokémon cards. Even small scratches can lower the grade.

#### Creases or Dents

Even a light crease will usually result in a grade no higher than PSA 6.

#### Gloss

The card’s original finish should remain intact. Loss of gloss can indicate handling or wear.

#### Print Lines

Thin lines that appear during manufacturing are considered flaws and can reduce the grade.

#### Stains or Dirt

Cards must be free from stains, smudges, or dirt to achieve higher grades.

### Perfect Surface for PSA 10

No visible scratches, creases, or surface wear under normal lighting.

Gloss and holographic shine should be intact.

## Additional Considerations
PSA takes into account other factors that could affect a card’s grade:

### Authenticity

PSA checks the card to ensure it’s not counterfeit or altered (e.g., trimmed or recolored).

Authenticity issues result in rejection, not grading.

### Size and Shape

Cards must meet the original Pokémon card dimensions.

If the card is miscut (factory error), it will either get a lower grade or receive a "miscut" label.

### Ink Quality

PSA evaluates the print quality, ensuring no discoloration or fading. Misprints are graded based on demand and quality.

## PSA Grading Scale Recap

| **Grade** | **Condition**   | **Criteria**                                                      |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PSA 10** | Gem Mint        | Perfect centering, sharp corners, clean edges, flawless surface. |
| **PSA 9**  | Mint            | Slightly off-center, tiny imperfections like minor edge whitening. |
| **PSA 8**  | NM-MT           | Slight wear on edges/corners, minor surface scratches.           |
| **PSA 7**  | NM              | Noticeable wear, small defects like light corner fuzz or scratches. |
| **PSA 6**  | EX-MT           | Moderate wear, small creases, or multiple minor flaws.           |
| **PSA 5**  | EX              | Heavier wear, noticeable edge/corner issues, or small creases.   |
| **PSA 4**  | VG-EX           | Major flaws, including multiple creases or heavy wear.           |
| **PSA 3**  | VG              | Significant damage, heavy creases, rounded corners.              |
| **PSA 2**  | Good            | Heavy wear, stains, or structural damage but still complete.     |
| **PSA 1**  | Poor            | Severe damage, including tears, missing pieces, or heavy discoloration. |

## How PSA Grades a Card: Step-by-Step

1. **Initial Inspection:** PSA professionals examine the card under strong lighting and magnification tools.
2. **Measurement of Centering:** Border thickness is checked to ensure the centering meets the criteria for the desired grade.
3. **Magnified Evaluation:** Corners, edges, and surface are carefully inspected for even the smallest flaws.
4. **Grade Assignment:** Multiple graders evaluate the card, and the final grade is assigned based on consensus.
5. **Encapsulation:** The card is sealed in a tamper-proof plastic case with a label showing its grade, serial number, and details.

## Pro Tips for Submitting Cards

- **Use Card Sleeves and Toploaders:** Protect your card during handling and shipping to avoid damage.
- **Clean the Surface Carefully:** Wipe dirt or smudges off gently with a soft microfiber cloth.
- **Check for Flaws Before Submitting:** Look for centering, edge whitening, and scratches under good lighting.
