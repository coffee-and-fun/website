## How to Find Your Apple Receipts or Request a Refund

This is Apple’s official portal for purchases tied to your Apple ID.

---

### 2. Log In With Your Apple ID

Sign in using the same Apple ID you used to make the purchase.

If you use multiple Apple IDs (very relatable), make sure you’re logged into the **right one**.

---

### 3. Find the Charge or Purchase

Once logged in, you’ll see a list of **recent purchases**, including:

- Apps & games  
- Subscriptions  
- In-app purchases  
- Movies, TV shows, music  

Scroll to find older charges or filter by date if needed.

Click the item you’re looking for.

### 4. View the Receipt

When you click a purchase, Apple will show you:

- The **date**
- The **amount charged**
- The **app or service**
- The **receipt details**

Perfect for:

### 5. Request a Refund (If Needed)

If something looks wrong—or you didn’t mean to buy it:

1. Click **Request a refund** or **Report a problem**
2. Choose a reason (accidental purchase, didn’t mean to subscribe, etc.)
3. Submit the request

Apple usually responds within **24–48 hours** by email.

> Refunds aren’t guaranteed, but Apple is generally fair—especially for recent or accidental
> purchases.

---

### 6. Check the Refund Status

You can revisit the same page anytime to see if your refund is:
