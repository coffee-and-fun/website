# What’s Coming for Coffee & Fun LLC in 2025?  

As we kick off 2025, we’re excited to share our plans for the year ahead. At Coffee & Fun LLC, we’re all about creating, experimenting, and having fun with tech. Here’s a glimpse of what’s in store.  

---

## Keeping Helperbird Awesome  

We will still be supporting the Helperbird team, that is our main focus, and we’re committed to making it even better in 2025. We’ll keep improving the tools, adding features, and making sure everything works smoothly for our users. Accessibility will always be at the heart of what we do.

## Getting Creative with New Tech  

This year, we’re diving into some fresh ideas and technologies that we think are super exciting:  

### VR Projects

With Apple’s headset out, we’re exploring what’s possible in virtual reality. Whether it’s apps or new tools, we’re ready to experiment.  

### Roomba Hacks

We want to take Roombas beyond cleaning! From smarter schedules to fun tweaks, we’re working on ways to get the most out of these little robots.  

### 3D Printing

We’re jumping into 3D printing with creative projects and guides. Whether you’re a pro or just starting out, we’ll be sharing tips and cool ideas.  

### Fix-It Guides

Broken devices? We’re writing easy-to-follow repair guides to help people fix their tech instead of tossing it.

## Exploring Pokémon Card Grading with AI  

Here’s something we’re really excited about: Pokémon card grading. If you’ve ever collected cards, you know how small details—like centering or corner sharpness—can decide if a card is graded a 1 or a perfect 10.  

We’ve bought **10 Pokémon booster packs** and a **PSA 10 card** to test how AI might help predict grades. With tools like ChatGPT and image recognition, we’re asking:  

- Can AI spot tiny imperfections?  
- Could it save collectors time and money?  

Imagine opening a pack and instantly knowing if you’ve got a rare, grade-worthy card. We’ll be experimenting and sharing what we learn.

## New Apps and Games  

We’re also working on some exciting new software projects:  

### **Step Hero**  

An iOS game that turns your daily steps into an adventure. Walk, run, or explore, and your steps will power your hero’s journey.  

### **AI Homework Helper**  

This app will help students solve tricky homework problems with a mix of AI magic and real learning support.

## Keeping Our Current Apps Strong  

While we’re diving into new ideas, we’ll keep supporting and improving all of our existing apps. You can count on updates and new features throughout the year.

## Looking Ahead  

2025 is shaping up to be a fun and creative year for us at Coffee & Fun LLC. From Pokémon cards and VR to 3D printing and new apps, we’re excited to keep building and exploring. Thanks for being part of the journey—let’s make this year amazing!
