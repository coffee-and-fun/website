At Coffee & Fun LLC, we’re always exploring new technology that could push our development projects to the next level. When the Vision Pro landed, we had to see what all the buzz was about. So, we made the leap and brought one in to test.

Right out of the box, it’s clear the Vision Pro is a marvel of engineering. This thing feels like a glimpse into the future. The interface, the display, the potential—it’s all jaw-dropping. But as incredible as it is, we quickly realized this isn’t something you casually throw on and forget about.

## The Weight of Innovation

One of the first things we noticed was the weight. At 22.9 ounces (or roughly the weight of an iPad Pro), it’s not exactly light. And trust us, you’ll feel every ounce after wearing it for a while. It’s not just the weight, though. The heat buildup after extended use made us take frequent breaks—it’s definitely something to get used to.

That said, once you adjust to the heft, it’s clear this isn’t just a gadget; it’s a whole new way to experience tech. The Vision Pro feels like it’s laying the foundation for what’s to come, and that’s exciting.

## Is It Worth It for Development?

Here’s where the big question comes in: is this worth the investment? From a development perspective, the Vision Pro feels very much like version 0. It’s an amazing piece of hardware, but its current use cases are somewhat limited outside of immersive media experiences. For us, we’re primarily interested in how this tech can fit into and enhance our projects—not just wow us with pretty visuals.

We’ve got a 14-day return window to really dig in and see what’s possible. That means testing it against our workflows, brainstorming potential app ideas, and seeing if it’s practical for the kind of work we do at Coffee & Fun.

## Final Thoughts (For Now)

Right now, we’re undecided. There’s no doubt the Vision Pro is groundbreaking, but it comes with its share of challenges—weight, heat, and its early-stage ecosystem being just a few. It’s a tough call to make because it’s clear this technology has a ton of potential, but potential doesn’t always translate into immediate value.

We’ll be spending the next two weeks experimenting with it and asking the big questions: Can this device enhance our work? Can we create something amazing with it? And most importantly, does it justify the hefty price tag?

Stay tuned as we continue to explore what the Vision Pro can (and can’t) do. We’ll share our final decision and any cool experiments we try out. For now, we’re cautiously optimistic—but we’ll let the testing do the talking.
