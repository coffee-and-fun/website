## üìù About Feedback Codes (General Info)  
Many companies provide survey codes on receipts. These are generally used to:  
- Collect opinions about service and product quality  
- Identify areas for improvement  
- Reward customers with discounts or freebies  

While each brand‚Äôs system is different, the purpose is always the same: **to listen to customers and improve experiences**.
