Alright. So sometimes you just want to clean house on Twitter. Not delete your whole account or go full digital detox. Just quietly remove some old tweets, un-retweet some stuff, maybe clean out your likes.

You know, like a vibe reset.

The problem is, Twitter doesn‚Äôt make that easy. There‚Äôs no bulk unlike or tweet deletion tool, and the third-party apps that offer it usually want full access to your account. That didn‚Äôt sit right with us.

So we made a little script.

You can run it directly in Chrome, no installs, no logins, no weird extensions. And it‚Äôll quietly start unliking, un-retweeting, and deleting your tweets while scrolling your profile for you.

And now? It‚Äôs even smart enough to pause when it hits Twitter‚Äôs action limit **or** when it sees those ‚Äútry again later‚Äù warnings.

---

## ‚òï What this script actually does

It works right inside your browser and mimics the clicks you‚Äôd normally do by hand. Here‚Äôs what it handles:

üíî **Unlikes tweets** you‚Äôve previously liked  

üîÅ **Un-retweets** any tweets you‚Äôve shared  

üóëÔ∏è **Deletes** your original tweets (not retweets)  

‚è¨ **Scrolls the page** automatically so it keeps finding more stuff  

üß† **Pauses after 50 actions** to avoid rate limits  

üëÄ **Watches for rate-limit messages** in the UI and pauses if needed

This is 100% local. It doesn‚Äôt send data anywhere, doesn‚Äôt log in to your account.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to use it in Chrome

### 1. Go to your Twitter profile  
Head to your own profile page. Where all your tweets, retweets, and likes are shown.

### 2. Open the Console  
Right-click anywhere on the page, click **Inspect**, then click the **Console** tab.

### 3. If Chrome blocks pasting code  
Type this into the console first and hit Enter:

```js

allow pasting

```

That just tells Chrome you‚Äôre cool with pasting code.


### 4. Paste in the script  
Now copy and paste the full script (below) into the console and press Enter. It‚Äôll start doing its thing automatically  scanning, clicking, scrolling, and waiting when needed.


```js

    await processTweets();
    await scrollPage();
    cycles++;

  }

  console.log("üéâ All done! Your profile should be looking way cleaner now. Grab a coffee and enjoy.");
})();



```


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Quick heads-up
Twitter rate-limits around 50 actions per 15 minutes. This script auto-detects that and pauses.

You can stop the script at any time by refreshing the page.

Got a lot of tweets? Run it again later or let it chill for a bit between runs.

### Why we built this

We just wanted a way to clean up our Twitter without giving some random app full access to our account. This does everything locally, safely, and quietly.

You don‚Äôt have to delete your entire account to feel fresh. Sometimes just clearing out the old stuff is enough.

If it helped, feel free to share it or bookmark it for later.
And if you want an Instagram version next? Let us know, it might already be brewing.

Catch you next cleanup
