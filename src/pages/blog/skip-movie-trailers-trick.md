Hey friends!

So here at Coffee & Fun, we're always doing fun little experiments. Some are techy. Some are snacky.
Some involve showing up at the movies at just the right time so you don‚Äôt get hit with 20 to 30
minutes of trailers, ads, and **please silence your phones** messages.

And this one? Oh, it's a game-changer.

## üçø The Problem: Too. Many. Trailers.

You know the drill. You buy your ticket, arrive **on time**, and then spend what feels like forever
waiting for the actual movie to start. Meanwhile, you're dodging spoilers, scrolling your phone
under your hoodie, and trying not to accidentally see something major.

Not fun.

And since we really hate spoilers (we literally made an extension to block them,
[Hide Spoilers](https://www.coffeeandfun.com/hide-spoilers-extension/) check it out!), we wanted to
find a way to arrive at the perfect moment. Not early. Not late. Just movie time.

## üîç The Trick: Use Food Pickup Time As a Clue

So here‚Äôs what we discovered‚Äîby accident at first, then on purpose, then three more times just to be
sure. If you're going to a theater like Cinemark or anywhere that lets you pre-order food, there's a
sneaky little timing trick:

**1.** Buy your ticket through the theater's app or website. **2.** Choose your snacks. (We
recommend the pretzel bites.) **3.** When it asks for a pickup time, pick the latest one available.

That time? **That‚Äôs when the actual movie starts.**

No trailers. No ads. Just grab your snacks and head straight to your seat as the opening scene rolls
in.

### üö® Heads-up: It‚Äôs for the Bold

If you're someone who likes to get comfy and scope out your seat early, maybe give yourself a little
buffer. But if you're on Team **No Spoilers, No Filler**, this is the hack you've been waiting for.

We can‚Äôt promise it'll work at every theater, but it's worked for us every time so far.

## üí¨ From the Coffee & Fun Lab

This was one of our favorite discoveries last year. It‚Äôs simple, silly, and just clever enough to
feel like a cheat code.

Whether you‚Äôre dodging movie spoilers or muting them online with Hide Spoilers, we‚Äôre always testing
ways to make life more fun‚Äîand a little less frustrating.

Got your own mini-experiment or weird movie hack? Tell us! We‚Äôre always listening, always curious,
and always down to try it out.

Catch ya at the movies (but like, exactly when the movie starts),

**Team Coffee & Fun ‚òïüéâ**
