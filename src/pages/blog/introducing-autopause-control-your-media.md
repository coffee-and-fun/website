Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m excited to share a new app weâ€™ve been working on at Coffee & Fun: **AutoPause**. Itâ€™s a small,
friendly, and super useful extension thatâ€™s here to make your life just a bit easier. Let me tell
you the story behind it and how it might just solve one of your everyday problems too.

## The Inspiration: A Critical Role Problem

My wife is a huge fan of **Critical Role**. (If you havenâ€™t heard of it, itâ€™s this amazing Dungeons
& Dragons series.) She loves watching it in bed before falling asleep, butâ€”and hereâ€™s the kickerâ€”she
_never_ pauses it when she dozes off. Every night, Iâ€™d have to stop what I was doing, grab her phone
or laptop, and pause it myself.

It was a little thing, but it happened enough that I started wondering: **What if there was a way to
set a timer to pause media automatically?** And just like that, the idea for AutoPause was born!

## What AutoPause Does

AutoPause is simple. You set a timer, and when the timeâ€™s up, it automatically pauses any audio or
video playing in your browser. No interruptions, no hassle. Just set it, and let it do its thing.

Here are some ways it can help

- Falling asleep while watching a show? AutoPause stops it for you.
- Need to focus on work but donâ€™t want your background music playing forever? AutoPause has your
  back.
- Want to avoid those awkward moments when a video plays endlessly on loop? Problem solved.

## Why I Love It

This app is personal for me. Itâ€™s not just about solving a minor inconvenience; itâ€™s about creating
tools that make life smoother in little ways. I love building things like this, and AutoPause is
another friendly app from **Coffee & Fun**, designed with care and simplicity in mind.

We believe in small, focused apps that do their job well. With AutoPause, we hope youâ€™ll enjoy a
little more peace of mind, knowing your media playback is under control.

## How It Works

Using AutoPause is a breeze:

### **Set a Timer**

Pick a durationâ€”1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, or more.

### **Relax**

AutoPause runs quietly in the background, keeping track of time.

### **Media Stops Automatically**

When the timer ends, all audio and video playing in your browser pauses.

And donâ€™t worryâ€”AutoPause respects your privacy. It doesnâ€™t track anything. Everything runs locally
in your browser, just the way it should.
