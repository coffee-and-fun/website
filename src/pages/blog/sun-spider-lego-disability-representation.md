## üï∑Ô∏è A Hero for Everyone

The new LEGO Collectible Minifigures Marvel Series 2 has delivered something truly special,
[Sun-Spider](<https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Charlotte_Webber_(Earth-20023)>), making her debut in
LEGO form! While Spider-Man fans might recognize heavy-hitters like Gwen Stacey and Miles Morales in
the lineup, it's the inclusion of this lesser-known hero that deserves a standing ovation.

## ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Who is Sun-Spider?

[Sun-Spider (Charlotte "Charlie" Webber)](<https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Charlotte_Webber_(Earth-20023)>)
first appeared in 2020's "Spider-Verse" comics as part of a contest where fans could create their
own Spider-Person. Created by Dayn Broder, Sun-Spider quickly captured hearts as a disabled
superhero who uses forearm crutches and deals with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a genetic condition
affecting connective tissues that can cause joint hypermobility, chronic pain, and fatigue.

What makes Charlie special isn't just her spider-powers ‚Äì it's how she adapts them to work with her
disability, not against it. She modified her web-shooters to work with her crutches and uses her
spider-sense to anticipate and prevent joint dislocations.

Her motto? **"I'm not in spite of anything. I AM."**

## üí™ Why This Matters

Seeing Sun-Spider in LEGO form is monumental for several reasons:

### Real Representation

For children (and adults!) with disabilities, seeing a hero who looks like them, crutches and all,
validates their experiences. The LEGO minifigure comes complete with her distinctive orange and
black costume and her mobility aids, showing that heroes come in all forms.

### Normalizing Disability

By including Sun-Spider alongside Spider-Man, Ghost-Spider, and other fan favorites, LEGO sends a
powerful message: disability is part of the superhero landscape. Charlie isn't a "special edition"
or relegated to a separate line ‚Äì she's right there with everyone else, ready for adventure.

### Expanding the Spider-Verse

While many casual fans might know Miles Morales or
[Spider-Gwen](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Woman_(Gwen_Stacy)>), Sun-Spider represents the
beautiful diversity of the Spider-Verse. Her inclusion introduces more people to this incredible
character and shows that Marvel's commitment to representation extends beyond the page.

## üéÆ The Power of Play

LEGO has always been about creativity and storytelling. Now, kids can create adventures where
[Sun-Spider](<https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Charlotte_Webber_(Earth-20023)>) teams up with
Spider-Man, where her unique perspective and abilities save the day, and where using mobility aids
is just another part of being a hero. This isn't just inclusion, it's celebration.

The attention to detail in the minifigure is remarkable too. Her crutches aren't an afterthought;
they're designed to fit perfectly with the LEGO system, allowing for dynamic poses and play
scenarios. It shows that LEGO didn't just include her for representation points ‚Äì they thoughtfully
designed her to be a fully functional part of the collection.

---

## üöÄ Looking Forward

Sun-Spider in LEGO form represents progress. It shows that toy companies are listening to calls for
better representation and that "lesser-known" characters can still make a massive impact.

For every child who sees themselves in Charlie, for every parent grateful to have these
conversations through play, and for every collector who understands the significance ‚Äì this is what
inclusion looks like.

Here's hoping this is just the beginning. If Sun-Spider can make it into a LEGO set, perhaps we'll
see:

- More disabled heroes across toy lines
- More diverse characters getting their spotlight
- More kids seeing that anyone can be a hero

---

## ‚ú® The Bottom Line

Because as Sun-Spider herself would say: heroes aren't defined by what they can't do, but by what
they choose to do with what they have.

The fact that LEGO chose to include a disabled character in their mainline Spider-Man series, not as
a token gesture but as a fully-realized character with properly designed accessories, shows real
commitment to diversity and inclusion.

This is the kind of representation that changes lives, one LEGO brick at a time.
