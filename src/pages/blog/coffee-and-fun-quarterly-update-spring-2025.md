# ☕ Quarterly Check-In from the Coffee & Fun Coffee Shop

Hey friends! Welcome to our first official **quarterly check-in** straight from the warm, slightly
chaotic, and very caffeinated corner of the internet we call **Coffee & Fun LLC**.

We wanted to give you a peek behind the curtain, talk about what we’ve been building, testing, and
breaking (on purpose, mostly), and share what’s next. So pull up a chair, sip something warm, and
let’s catch up.

## 🤖 Roomba, but make it smarter

Last year, we got ourselves a Roomba. We ran it a lot. Like, _a lot a lot_. And honestly, while it’s
great, we started seeing ways to make it even better.

So we're kicking off a new project: **open source (and maybe even paid) tools for Roomba** lovers.
First up? A **kit that lets you see what your Roomba sees** — straight from your phone or computer.
Because if it’s going to crash into chairs, we at least want to watch it happen in real time.

This is just the beginning, and we’re excited to share more soon.

## 🔠 Fonts with heart: OpenDyslexic & Elexend

Our font-focused extensions **OpenDyslexic** and **Elexend** — just got a major glow-up.  
We redesigned the UI, made everything snappier, and fixed a bunch of little things that were bugging
us (and probably you too).

We’re still actively supporting both extensions and plan to keep improving accessibility-focused
tools like these.

---

## 📝 More blogs, more vibes

We’re sharing more behind-the-scenes stories, experiments, and tools right here on our blog. You’ll
find everything from movie hacks to weird hardware setups — and maybe a few coffee-fueled rants.
It's all part of the fun.

---

## 💬 Come hang out: Discord is live!

It’s still early days, but we’ve officially launched a **Coffee & Fun Discord server**. This will be
our go-to hangout spot for bug reports, feedback, sneak peeks, and general nerding out.

Want to be part of the chaos? Come say hi!

## 🚀 Hide Spoilers is taking off

One of our favorite little side projects —
[**Hide Spoilers**](https://www.coffeeandfun.com/hide-spoilers-extension/) — quietly blew up thanks
to the hype around Apple TV's _Severance_ Season 2 finale.

Let’s just say, spoiler-free browsing is **in** right now, and we’re fully embracing it. This
response is pushing us to keep developing it with more features and better support.

---

## 🧠 Markdown Editor hits 20K users

Our **Markdown Editor for Safari** just crossed **20,000 users** and is featured on the Apple App
Store. We’re beyond stoked.

We’ve got even more updates planned, so stay tuned if you’re a fan of clean, focused writing tools.

---

## 🦉 Helperbird: A fresh new look

Our biggest app, **Helperbird**, got a serious refresh. The UI is cleaner and snappier.  
It now fully supports **dark mode**, **light mode**, and **word prediction** is sharper than ever.  
**iOS and Mac support** also got smoother.

Oh, and we added **Bing-powered translations**, with more tools and improvements on the way.

## 🧾 Some 2024 facts (as we prep for taxes 😅)

- We gave away a **MacBook Pro**, **iPad**, and a bunch of **Apple accessories**
- Partnered with **StickerApp.com** for cool merch and advertising
- Traveled to **New Orleans** to talk with schools
- Visited **Austin** to hear from users IRL
- Ran tons of in-person interviews to plan out new Helperbird features
- Gave talks at major conferences like **EduChange**
- Upgraded our testing tools
- Got nerdy with VR headsets (they’re amazing, but yeah, still pricey)

It's been a weird, wonderful, experimental kind of year — exactly how we like it.

## ❤️ Let’s keep building

Whether you’ve been with us since day one or just found us through a random spoiler-blocking rabbit
hole, we’re so glad you’re here.

We’ve got so much more to share in the next few months — from open source projects to app updates,
new experiments, giveaways, and more.

Come hang with us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/J6EeMvSBYg), follow us on
[Twitter](https://x.com/bycoffeeandfun), or just shoot us an email. We’re building this all in the
open, coffee in hand.

Talk soon,  
**The Coffee & Fun Crew ☕**
